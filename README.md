<p>created solely for the purpose of revision. the author is against malpractice.
the .pptx is the original file created by the faculty themselves.
the individual files have been circulating for a while prior to the exam. 
there is one pdf that includes all the programs. note that they may not match the individual programs.
good luck.</p>
